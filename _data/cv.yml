      description:
        - Led the migration effort of NCR Payments Solutions built in Go and C++ to Azure Kubernetes Service, increasing the system scalability by 2x and achieving availability rate of 99.95%.
        - Incorporated Helm and Argo CD to drive continuous delivery, reducing build time by 45% and errors by 75%.
        - Streamlined the development process by creating Bash scripts to automate local dev environment setup.

    - title: Research Fellow
      institution: National Center for Supercomputing Application, SciAuth Project
      year: Jan 2023 - Apr 2023
      description:
        - Collaborated on a student-led research project in cybersecurity, built on prior work by the NSF SciTokens project. 
        - Built a new module for the SciTokens library based on Python JSON Web Tokens to allow users to generate sample tokens with custom payloads from the command-line, enabling testing and experimentation in OAuth2 workflows.
        - Incorporated Flask frameworks to demonstrate web token authorization within the SciTokens library.

    - title: Anderson Summer Research Scholar
      institution: Denison University â€“ Natural Language Processing Lab
      year: Feb 2022 - Aug 2022
      description:
        - Fine-tuned three variants of BERT on SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the robustness of current machine reading comprehension models.
        - Identified the advantages of fine-tuning models on additional unanswerable questions in improving robustness against adversarial attacks, compared to those fine-tuned solely on answerable questions.
        - Conducted extensive literature reviews, synthesized research findings to support key arguments, and actively participated in manuscript drafting of the publication.
