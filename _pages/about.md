I am an undergraduate student at Denison University, pursuing a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BA in Computer Science. <strong>I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2024.</strong>

My research interests focus on the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence in response to the challenges in medical image analysis. I am particularly fascinated by the use of deep learning in medical image segmentation and registration to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes. In my graduate studies, I seek to explore data-efficient learning algorithms, including self-supervised, few-shot, and active learning, to leverage from the vast amounts of medical data while addressing the common "long-tail" distribution. In addition, I am eager to apply explainable AI techniques that can provide all users and stakeholders with reliable and transparent solutions.
