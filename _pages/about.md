I am an undergraduate student at Denison University, pursuing a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BA in Computer Science. <strong>I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2024.</strong>

My research interests revolve around the complex interplay between students and AI-assisted learning tools in the digital age. I am particularly intrigued by how these advanced technologies are reshaping the educational landscape, impacting both the learning and teaching experiences. My graduate study goal is to leverage the multifaceted aspects of this interaction to develop intelligent learning systems that provide personalized learning content, feedback, and assessments.

<strong>Keywords:</strong> human-computer interaction, AI, educational technology, AI-augmented learning systems

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
